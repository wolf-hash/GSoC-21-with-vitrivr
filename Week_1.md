## Week #1 
Hi everyone! I am Karan, a 2nd year student at VIT Vellore. This summer I will be working on a project called *vitrivr reads* which would require me to implemement a feature module within [Cineast](https://github.com/vitrivr/cineast) which will be capable of Scene Text Transcription. The challenge in this project is to implement the model in Java using the Tensorflow Java bindings. 
My this weeks goal will be to test different available scene text transcription models and then write a standalone Java program which should be able to run inference on the shortlisted model. As my stretch goals I will be working on the data collection and training scripts for optimizing or training the selected model from scratch.
## What did I do this week?
We had an introductory meeting to kickoff the coding perios GSoC 2021 where I got the opportunity to interact with all the members of the vitrivr team and also got to know other participants working with vitrivr this summer. I had another meeting later this week with just my mentors and I discussed different models that could be viable for this project. 
We decided that the preferred approach would be for me to first implement the feature module using the Tensorflow java bindings and after that I can focus on training that model to fit our needs. I also started coding before hand to actually make use of this free period. I have implemented the inception net model using the Tensorlfow Java bindings (repo can be found [here](https://github.com/wolf-hash/Tensorflow-Java-Inception-Classifier)). This brings me a step closer to solving the biggest problem of this project which was to run Tensorflow models in Java.
